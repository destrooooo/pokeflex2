# You need to know one thing before reading this and trying the projetc

This project was a school project created by 4 people. But they encountered a major bug that made their motivation disappear, even some people were more invested in the project than others.
The bug encountered is in the API's retrieval of pokemon types. Indeed, the API documentation is not clear, it is impossible to understand which expression to use to retrieve the information.

This bug prevents the application from functioning normally. in fact, the game consists of 2 people who compete like ping-pong, exchanging at each move a pokemon name comprising at least 1 type corresponding to the type of the previously mentioned pokemon.

the first person to fail loses a life. The first person to lose 3 lives loses the game.

Most game files are commented to explain the code.

If this project was not able to see the light of day it is surely due to a lack of involvement of certain people and the encounter of a bug which discouraged those most invested.

Be free to take the project or concept to make it your own

Liste_PKMN_FR_EN is a database we wanted to use to transform french inputs into english ones for the API to make the game suitable for both languages



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
